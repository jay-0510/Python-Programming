# String formatting can be done in python using the format method.

# It is a new string formatting mechanism introduced by the PEP 498. It is also known as Literal String Interpolation or more commonly as F-strings (f character preceding the string literal). The primary focus of this mechanism is to make the interpolation easier.

val = 'Geeks'
print(f"{val}for{val} is a portal for {val}.")
name = 'Rohan'
age = 23
print(f"Hello, My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.")


# print(txt.format())
print(type(f"{2 * 30}"))
