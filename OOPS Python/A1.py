# INTRODUCTION TO OOPS ----

# Mainly two approaches :
# 1. Procedural Programming (Functional)
# 2. Object Oriented Programming (Object -Oriented)

# The procedure we are following till now is the “Procedural Programming” approach. It involves writing a program in which everything is done.
# The basic idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is to use classes and objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.


# An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods.

# One of the key features of OOP in Python is encapsulation, which means that the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods. This helps to protect the object's data and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways.

# Polymorphism is also supported in Python, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class.

# In summary, OOP in Python allows developers to model real-world concepts and entities using classes and objects, encapsulate data, reuse code through inheritance, and write more flexible code through polymorphism.
