# PYTHON SETS:
'Sets are unordered collection of data items.'
'They store multiple items in a single variable. Set items are separated by commas and enclosed within curly brackets {}.'
'Sets are unchangeable, meaning you cannot change items of the set once created. Sets do not contain duplicate items.'
'Python doesnt take guarantee of order maintain.'


# Accessing set items
info = {"Carla", 19, False, 5.9}
for item in info:
    print(item)


# Try to create an empty set. Check using the type() function whether the type of your variable is a set
Ronaldo = set()
print(type(Ronaldo))
'SYNTAX for set & Dictionary both start & end with curly brackets.... So it gives empty dictionary not set.'
